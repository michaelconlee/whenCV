				<li><strong>2018:</strong> WHEN Collective had a successful founding year, participating in several DIY artist events throughout San Francisco. At these events, the organization was able to sell out of all of their artist prints, bringing in a significant amount of revenue to support their mission.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>2019:</strong> With grant support, WHEN Collective was able to host a large art event in New York City that showcased the work of many talented artists. This event was a huge success, with the venue filled to capacity with attendees enjoying the live music and artist editions on display. The event helped to raise awareness for the organization and the artists they support.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>2020:</strong> WHEN Collective published their first-ever issue of WHEN Magazine, featuring original artist works and writing. The magazine was well-received by readers and helped to establish the organization as a presence in the DIY arts scenes in California and New York.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>2021:</strong> Building on the success of their previous event, WHEN Collective once again hosted a grant-supported art event in New York City. This event was even more successful than the previous year, with the venue filled to capacity once again. Attendees enjoyed the wide variety of artist editions on display and the live music performances.</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>2022:</strong> WHEN Collective launched WHEN FM, an internet radio station that provides a platform for college-aged DJs and musicians to share their work and express their love for music. The radio station also serves as a mentorship program, providing guidance and support to young musicians looking to improve their craft. The launch of WHEN FM was a major milestone for the organization, expanding their reach and impact beyond their existing events and publications.</li>
